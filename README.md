# Basic-Neural-Network
Create a simple Neural Network using python and numpy.
My plan with this repository is to start with the most basic implementation of a Neural Network with the minimal use of ML libraries. I would like to start with a Simple Artificial Neural Network (having no hidden units or in other words having just input and output layer , then go on to build complex artificial networks like CNN,RNN using just numpy and python.
