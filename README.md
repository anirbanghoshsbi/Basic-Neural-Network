# Basic-Neural-Network
Create a simple Neural Network using python and numpy.
My plan with this repository is to start with the most basic implementation of a Neural Network with the minimal use of ML libraries. I would like to start with a Simple Artificial Neural Network (having no hidden units or in other words having just input and output layer , then go on to build complex artificial networks like CNN,RNN using just numpy and python.

# Feed Forward / backpropagation Algorithm :

# feed forward algorithm :
calculates the output_vector from the input_vector.

# Backpropagation algorithm : 
Is an algorithm to train (adjust weights) of neural network.The input of an back propagation algorithm is an output_vector and the output is am adjusted_weight_vector.

While training a Neural Network we _require both_ feed forward and backpropagation algorithms.

Whereas while making inferences that is prediction we _only need the feed-forward algorithm, that is when we are using a 
neural network , we are just using  feed forward algorithm.

A basic multi lauyer perceptron is an multi -layer feed forward back-propagation neural network.
